Attendence Meter : 
To create an attendance meter that store records of whether individuals are present or not, including the time of their attendance we can design a simple meter that :

1. Registers attendance: Allows a user to mark themselves as present or absent.
2. Logs the time: Records the exact time when attendance is marked.
3. Stores records: Saves the attendance records in a file for future reference.
